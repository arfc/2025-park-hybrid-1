Modeling and simulating control rods requires high-fidelity neutronics methods to accurately
capture the strong angular dependence in the local neutron flux. However, high-fidelity methods
remain too computationally expensive for time-dependent reactor analyses without extensive
computational resources. This work introduces a novel hybrid $S_N$-diffusion method for accurate
and computationally efficient control rod neutronics modeling in molten salt reactors.
The hybrid method combines the strengths of the $S_N$ and neutron diffusion methods by generating
transport corrections using the $S_N$ method near control rods while keeping computational costs
low elsewhere. The $S_N$ and neutron diffusion solvers are coupled
through an adaptive boundary coupling algorithm that allows the solver to adapt to the
transport correction parameters and preserve smooth neutron flux gradients across the interface.
In 1-D and 2-D $k$-eigenvalue simulations, the hybrid method produced accurate control
rod worth estimates relative to reference Monte Carlo neutron transport solutions.
With the hybrid method's spatial resolution and efficient computational performance, the hybrid
method could provide a viable pathway to accurate and cost-efficient numerical simulations
of asymmetric transients in molten salt reactors.
